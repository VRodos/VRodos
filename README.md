### Troubleshooting

* Wordpress API is not working :  Settings -> Permalinks -> Post name (as Structure)  


* CORS
  You need wordpress at port 80 (apache2 standard) to allow to give content to aframe at node.js server at port 5832

Add this to .htaccess

<IfModule mod_headers.c>
	Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
</IfModule>

* Big 3D models
 
  Add these to .htaccess to allow big files to be uploaded to wordpress 

  - php_value upload_max_filesize 512M
  - php_value post_max_size 512M
  - php_value memory_limit 1024M
  - php_value max_execution_time 1800
  - php_value max_input_time 1800
  - php_value max_input_vars 4000


### Servers install and run

Two types of servers are needed:

  - Apache server, e.g. locally using Xampp (Windows and Linux are supported).
    - It can run on http://127.0.0.1:80
    - Xampp server is used for the content of the scenes.
    - Xampp contains also mysql server which is needed for WordPress to work (and somewhere to save the data).
  - Node.js server for Networked-Aframe. To start Node.js server 
    1) Go to networked-aframe/server and type: 
        > npm install --force
        
        - Force is needed because some packages are obsolete
    2) Run server:
        > start node .\easyrtc-server.js
        
        - Go to http://127.0.0.1:5832/index_60.html - where 60 should be replaced with the id of your scene - to see if your server is delivering anything. Xampp server should be up and running as a prerequisite because the content is fetched from http://127.0.0.1:80 as Node.js handles only streaming data for the multi-playing.
